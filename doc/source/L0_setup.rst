Getting ready for computational exercises
=========================

In the course notes you will encounter computational exercises for you
to complete.  The object of these exercises is to build up
understanding about how computational linear algebra algorithms
actually work. Along the way you will have the opportunity to pick up
valuable scientific computing skills in coding, software engineering
and rigorous testing. They involve completing unfinished "skeleton"
code, which we will then use in the courseworks.

In this preliminary section, we will explain how to get set up to do
the computational exercises. If you have taken Principles of
Programming (a second year optional course on our undergraduate
Mathematics programme) then you will have already been shown how to
do most of this. If not, we will provide some links to some material
on that course that it is well worth reading.

You can use your own laptop running Windows, Linux, or macOS. 

There is a lot of information below, but here is a summary checklist to
check that you have everything ready to do your work.

   1. Install Python, Git and a text editor using the instructions below.
   2. Create a working folder and put a virtual environment in it (venv).
   3. Clone your course repository from Github Classroom into the
      working folder.
   4. Activate the venv.
   5. Install :mod:`numpy` to the venv, and :mod:`pytest`.
   6. Install the course module to the venv.
   7. Remember to activate the venv every time you work on the course module.
   8. Make sure that you understand how to run code in the course repository
      (including your own code you have added).
   9. Make sure that you understand how to commit your changes to your
      Git repository and how to push them to Github.
   10. Make sure that you know how to run the tests.
      
To follow these steps read the sections below.


Getting the software that you need
==================================

The core requirements are Python (version >=3.7), Git, and a
Python-aware text editor.

In order to write the code required for the implementation exercise,
you'll need to use a Python-aware text editor. There are many such
editors available and you can use any you like. If you haven't used
Python and/or Git before, it is a good idea to use Visual Studio Code
(VSCode) which is a Python-aware text editor, since VSCode also
provides a Terminal and an interface to Git.

Up to date information on how to install Python, Git and VSCode on a
Windows, Linux or Mac machine is available at the `Installing the
necessary software
<https://object-oriented-python.github.io/installation.html>`_
section of the Principles of Programming website.

.. proof:task::

   Install Python, Git and VSCode (or your preferred text editor for
   coding) on your computer that you will use for this course.

.. hint::

   If you are a Mac user, you'll need to avoid using the preinstalled
   Python on your system, as it is a very cut down version for
   interacting with the MacOS. You should install a fully featured
   Python (using Anaconda or Homebrew, as described in the link above).
   
.. hint::

   If you want to use Imperial's computer lab machines, they have the
   software you need installed, in some cases via the `Software
   Hub`. To get started, double click the `Software Hub` icon on the
   desktop or visit the `Software Hub
   <https://softwarehub.imperial.ac.uk/>`_ page.

The Terminal
================

A lot of the routine activity involved in this module revolves around
executing commands on the Bash terminal (sometimes referred to as the
"command line"). For example you use the terminal to work with the
revision control system. If you're not familiar with the Linux
terminal, then you can read this `brief guide to the terminal
<http://www.tuxarena.com/static/intro_linux_cli.php>`_. That guide
focusses on the Bash shell, which is the one we will use.

.. hint::

   In VSCode you can get a terminal by selecting New Terminal from the
   Terminal menu. This should open a Terminal window on your VS Code
   screen.  To the top right of this window is a pulldown menu to
   select the interpreter, which needs to be Bash. The image to the
   right shows this pulldown menu.

   .. image:: _static/bash.png
      :align: right
      :width: 20ex

.. hint::

   In VSCode, to ensure you are using the correct Python interpreter,

   1. Go to the View menu and select the Command Palette.
   2. Start typing `Python: Select Interpreter`, and click on it when it
      comes up.
   3. Select the correct Python interpreter from the pulldown menu (on
      Mac, the one you installed from Homebrew or Anaconda, on
      Windows, the one that you installed from Anaconda).
   
.. _bitbucket-git:

Python virtual environment
==========================

The next step is to set up a Python virtual environment using the
Terminal. This is described in `Section 1.2
<https://object-oriented-python.github.io/1_introduction.html#setting-up-a-python-virtual-environment>`_
of the Principles of Programming website.

.. proof:task::

   Create a new virtual environment for your Computational Linear
   Algebra work and activate it, following the instructions of Section
   1.3 of PoP linked above.

   Two differences are as follows.

   1.  You should name the working folder something more relevant to
       this course!
   2.  You should name the venv:

          clavenv

       instead of:

          PoP_venv

.. hint::

   It is recommended you keep this name to avoid spuriously committing
   venv files to the git repository.  If you decide to give your venv a
   different name, please add that name to the .gitignore file in your
   git repository. If you don't know what this means, it is probably best
   to use the name "clavenv".
	  
.. proof:task::

   Following the instructions in `Section 1.3
   <https://object-oriented-python.github.io/1_introduction.html#installing-python-packages>`_
   of the Principles of Programming website, install the :mod:`numpy` and
   :mod:`pytest` packages to your venv (don't forget to activate it first).

GitHub and git
==============

Revision control is a mechanism for recording and managing different
versions of changing software. This enables changes to be tracked and
helps in the process of debugging code, and in managing conflicts when
more than one person is working on the same project. Revision control
can be combined with online hosting to provide secure backups and to
enable you to work on code from different locations.

In this module, you'll use revision control to access the skeleton
files. You'll also use the same revision control system to record the
edits you make over time and to submit your work for feedback and,
eventually, marking.

We will be using the revision control system `git
<http://git-scm.com/>`_, which has cornered the market in this area
now. We'll be combining git with the online hosting service GitHub.

There is a brief introduction to Git in the `Just Enough Git to Get By
<https://object-oriented-python.github.io/a2_git.html#git>`_ section
of the Principles of Programming website.

.. proof:task::

   Read through (or review, if you read it before) Sections 2.1, 2.2, and
   2.3 of Just Enough Git to Get By.

.. proof:task::

   Configure your Git installation by following the instructions in
   Section 2.4 of Just Enough Git to Get By.

.. hint::

   These instructions involve typing into the Terminal. VSCode
   provides other ways to configure but it is much easier to get help
   if you are typing into the Terminal. Make sure that you have selected
   the Bash interpreter for your Terminal.

.. proof:task::

   Create and/or setup your Github account following the instructions
   in Section 2.5 of Just Enough Git to Get By.

.. proof:task::

   If you have not done it before, complete the simple exercise in
   Section 2.6 of Just Enough Git to Get By. This exercise uses the
   Git Training Assignment which is linked on Blackboard, which you
   should clone into your working folder.

.. hint::

   Above all else, never use::

     git add -A

   or:

     git add *
     
   to add all the files in the repository. This is bad practice and
   makes a mess for the markers, making them grumpy. When you commit
   changes to files in your repository for this course, just use::

     git add

   to add the files you changed to the list of files to be updated
   in the commit history.

   Similarly, VSCode has a graphic interface for Git. It is preferred
   to use the Terminal in this course, as it is easier to get help.
   If you do decide to use the graphic interface, just ignore any
   files that are marked as not added. Do not try to click them to
   remove the marks.

.. warning::

   Never clone a repository inside the folder of another folder.
   
Setting up your repository
==========================

We're using a tool called `GitHub classroom
<https://classroom.github.com>`_ to automate the creation of your
copies of the repository. Follow the link on Blackboard marked "Course
Repository" to create your personal repository for the course. Then,
clone it to your working folder on your computer following the
instructions in the previous section.

.. warning::

   When you follow the link, you will be asked to select your
   "school's identifier" from a list. This will be your user ID that
   you use to log into Outlook (e.g., sbc21). If you don't find your
   ID on the list, *do not* click "Skip to the next step". And, *do
   not* click someone else's ID! Instead, contact the course leader
   and ask to have your user ID added. We need to do this so that we
   can grade your work.

.. hint::

   To change folder in the terminal, type `cd <path>` where `<path>`
   is the path to the folder you want to change to. Paths can be
   "absolute" e.g. `/home/users/jbloggs/comp-lin-alg/` or "relative"
   e.g. if you are currently in `/home/users/jbloggs` then you can use
   `comp-lin-alg`.  Typing `pwd` shows the current path, and typing
   `ls` shows the contents of the current folder.  Typing `cd ..`
   changes to the enclosing folder, and typing `cd -` changes back to
   the previous folder. For more information see the "brief guide to
   the terminal" linked above.

.. hint::
   
   In VSCode, you will be asked if you want to make this venv the default
   for your project. Select "yes" as this will help to ensure that it is
   activated.

.. hint::

   **Every time** you want to work on the implementation exercises and
   courseworks, you need to activate the venv.

.. warning::

   Your classroom repository will contain a branch called "feedback".
   Do not commit to, or remove, this branch. This is how we will
   provide feedback on your code.

Installing the course package to the venv
-----------------------------------------

In this course we will be working on skeleton code stored as a Python
package in the repository. This means that we will be able to import
everything as a module using `from cla\_utils import *` without needing
to be in a particular folder. This is what makes the tests work,
for example.

.. proof:task::

   Install the course package to your venv.
   To do this:

   1. Activate the clavenv as above.
   2. Change folder to the repository that you just checked out (this
      should contain folders called `doc`, `cla\_utils`, `test`, etc.).
   3. Type `python -m pip install -e .`

      
.. proof:task::
      
   Read this useful information on `Modules
   <https://object-oriented-python.github.io/2_programs_in_files.html#modules>`_
   and `Packages
   <https://object-oriented-python.github.io/2_programs_in_files.html#packages>`_
   that will be useful later.

How to do the computational exercises
=====================================

For the computational exercises, quite a lot of the coding
infrastructure you will need is provided already. Your task is to
write the crucial mathematical operations at key points, as described
on this website.

The code on which you will build is in the ``cla_utils`` folder of
your repository. The code has embedded documentation which is used to
build the :doc:`cla_utils` web documentation.

As you do the exercises, **commit your code** to your repository. This
will build up your computational exercise solution sets. You should
commit code early and often - small commits are easier to understand
and debug than large ones. Push your commits to your remote repository
on Github.

.. hint::

   In Git, we use the Terminal to commit changes and push them to the
   remote repository on Github Classroom. A repository is a record of
   the history of the code as you are working.  To add a file to the
   list of files whose changes will be committed to the repository,
   type `git add <filename> -m <log message>`, where `<log message>`
   is a short description of the changes you made.  To commit those
   changes, type `git commit`. They will now be saved locally.  To
   push these changes to the "remote" repository on Github Classroom,
   type `git push` (you may be asked to set the name of the remote,
   just paste the suggested command into the Terminal). To pull
   changes from the remote repository on Github Classroom, type `git
   pull`. For further features and better explanation, please take
   a look at the Github Tutorial linked above.

.. warning::

   Never use `git add *`, since this will add unwanted files to the
   repository which shouldn't be there. You should never add machine
   specific files such as your venv, or `.pyc` files which are
   temporary machine specific files generated by the Python
   interpreter.  This really slows down the marking process and makes
   the markers grumpy. You should only add the `.py` files that you
   are working on.

.. warning::
   
   Do not commit to the feedback branch.  This branch is just there so
   that we can provide feedback on your changes to the main branch,
   and if you commit there, it will mess up our marking system.

Running your work
=================

If you want to execute your code written in `cla\_utils`, this can be
imported into IPython (in the terminal, or using a Jupyter notebook),
or in a script.

To use IPython, type `ipython` in the Terminal (when the venv is
activated). You may need to install it first using `python -m pip install
ipython` (you must start the venv first). Then you can import
:mod:`cla_utils` interactively using `from cla_utils import *`. To exit
IPython type Ctrl-D.

.. proof:task::

   Briefly read this `Information about IPython
   <https://object-oriented-python.github.io/2_programs_in_files.html#ipython>`_.

If you also import `numpy` then you can create
example `numpy` arrays and pass them to :mod:`cla_utils` functions to try
them out. You can also do this in a script, e.g.::

  from cla_utils import *
  from numpy import *
  A = numpy.array([[1.0,2.0,0.,0.,1.0+1.0j],
                  [0.0,1.0,3.,0.,0.],
		  [0.0,0.0,1.,0.,0.],
		  [0.0,0.0,0.,1.,0.],
		  [0.0,0.0,0.,0.,1.]])
  xr = numpy.array([1.,2.,1.,0.5,0.3])
  xi = numpy.array([1.1,0.2,0.,1.5,-0.7])
  ABiC(A, xr, xi)

After saving your text to a script with a filename ending in `.py`,
e.g.  `run\_ABiC.py`, you can execute the script in the Terminal by
typing `python run\_ABiC.py` (remember to change to the folder where
the file is located). Scripts are better because you can run the whole
thing again more easily if you make a mistake, and you can save them.

.. proof:task::

   Briefly read this `information about Python scripts
   <https://object-oriented-python.github.io/2_programs_in_files.html#python-scripts-and-text-editors>`_.

.. warning::

   Don't clutter up your repository by adding these experimental scripts
   with `git add`. If you want to store them it is best to use another
   separate git repository for that.

Testing your work
=================

As you complete the exercises, there will often be test scripts which
check the code you have just written. These are located in the
``test`` folder and employ the `pytest <http://pytest.org/>`_
testing framework. You run the tests with:: 

   python -m pytest test_script.py

from the bash Terminal, replacing ``test_script.py`` with the
appropriate test file name (remember to activate the venv first). The
``-x`` option to ``pytest`` will cause the test to stop at the first
failure it finds, which is often the best place to start fixing a
problem. For those familiar with debuggers, the ``--pdb`` option will
drop you into the Python debugger at the first error.

You can also run all the tests by running ``pytest`` on the tests
folder. This works particularly well with the -x option, resulting
in the tests being run in course order and stopping at the first
failing test::

  python -m pytest -x tests/

You should make sure that your code passes tests before moving on
to the next exercise.

Coding style and commenting
===========================

Computer code is not just functional, it also conveys information to
the reader. It is important to write clear, intelligible code. **The
readability and clarity of your code will count for marks**.

The Python community has agreed standards for coding, which are
documented in `PEP8
<https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>`_. There are programs and
editor modes which can help you with this. The skeleton implementation
follows PEP8 quite closely. You are encouraged, especially if you are
a more experienced programmer, to follow PEP8 in your
implementation. However nobody is going to lose marks for PEP8
failures.

Skeleton code documentation
===========================

There is web documentation for the complete :doc:`cla_utils`. There is
also an :ref:`alphabetical index <genindex>` and a :ref:`search page<search>`.
