   MATH60024/MATH70024 - Computational Linear Algebra.

   .. warning::

      This course is undergoing substantial revision and reorganisation
      going into Academic Year 23/24, and hence these pages are likely to
      change in substantial ways as the course goes underway.

   A PDF version of the course notes is `available here
   <Computationallinearalgebracourse.pdf>`_.  The lecture material for this
   course is available as videos linked from the web version of the
   notes.

   The text for this part of the module is Trefethen and Bau
   *Numerical Linear Algebra*. Another very useful reference is
   Golub and van Loan *Matrix Computations*.
   
   We provide a complete set of notes for the course below.
