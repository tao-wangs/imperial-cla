General course information
==========================

Course leader
-------------

The module is led by `Prof Colin Cotter
<http://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/colin.cotter>`_, a Professor of
Computational Mathematics. He researches computational methods for
atmosphere and ocean modelling (as well as other geophysical fluid
models), computational image registration, data assimilation and
a collection of other things that require numerical algorithms and
discretisations. Computational linear algebra tools form part of
his day-to-day research work.

Accreditation
-------------

This module is an accredited elective for third and fourth year
mathematics and JMC undergraduates. It is also approved for the `MSc
in Applied Mathematics
<http://www.imperial.ac.uk/study/pg/courses/mathematics/applied-mathematics/>`_. Other
masters and PhD students wishing to take the module should contact the
course lecturer in the first instance (but information about
timetables and assessment submission should be requested from the
Mathematics Undergraduate Office).

Assumed knowledge
-----------------

The theory component of the module will assume only a familiarity with
undergraduate linear algebra.

The implementation will be in Python, a very high level and simple
language with similarities to Matlab. We won't use that many features
of Python though, mainly just functions and loops. If you haven't done
any Python before, then it is worth referring to `the official Python
tutorial <https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html>`_ as you work
through the exercises (Sections 1 to 5 are a good start).

We will use the version control system Git to manage our code in
files. We will combine this with Github Classroom to submit your code
and get feedback on it. This has all been introduced in the second
year course Principles of Programming. If you have not taken this
course, it just means that you'll need to spend a little extra time at
the beginning covering a few of the basic topics on using Python in
files, packages and dealing with Github. In the course we will link to
the relevant part of the Principles of Programming notes so that you
can catch up on these skills.

Assessment
----------

The module will be assessed by submission of two courseworks and
an examination. The courseworks are submitted during Autumn Term,
and contribute 25% of the marks each. Each coursework comprises
a pdf report submitted on Blackboard and a code submission on Github.
The examination takes place in the main exam period and contributes
50% of the marks.

Mastery
.......

All Department of Mathematics fourth year and masters courses must
contain a mastery component to distinguish them from the third year
versions. This part of the course is only for completion by those
students: third year students are exempt.  The mastery component of
this module will be an additional question on each coursework, plus an
additional question on the exam. The exam mastery question will not
cover additional material, just a greater depth of understanding and
synthesis. The coursework mastery questions may require some
additional literature research.

Blackboard
----------

Important announcements and the coursework submission will be
conducted via Blackboard. Please ensure you are enrolled in this
module on Blackboard!
